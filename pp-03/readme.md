## ITMD 362, Production Problem 03: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette
(you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make).
Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0k4vn300++00t9oVuKNA4u  
Your Rationale: Most gaming sites are split in the palettes, either they are dark or bright.
For this I chose the bright because it pops and it has worked for Nintendo https://www.nintendo.com/switch/
and Sony PlayStation https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/ps4/. So the way I set
it up was with a bright background and bright colors for the foreground.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52O0R0kDDsV9fEwpcwFNblPX1cY  
Your Rationale: I chose this because I felt that it would be best to use more colors
that represent nature, so I started with green. And with this there is the blue, which
could resemble sky or water. Last, a yellow to pop with the green and give it more accent.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet
