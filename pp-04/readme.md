# Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android/Google, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).
Focus on touch-related elements.

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Android:
  https://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL):https://material.io/guidelines/components/bottom-navigation.html#bottom-navigation-usage

* How you implemented it in your sketch:  
The problem with the myIIT site is that there is stuff just thrown on the page with
no regard of what the content is and where to look for it. So having a navigation
bar at the bottom of the page will work to organize the content and make it more
accessible for the user. This is useful for both mobile and tablet/desktop users
depending on the screen size.

* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://material.io/guidelines/components/text-fields.html#text-fields-layout

* How you implemented it in your sketch:  
Another problem with myIIT is that when a user logs in with their credentials and
enters the wrong username or password it brings them to a different page telling them
it is wrong and has a link back to the main page. For this, I thought about using the text
fields and providing proper spacing and errors of what is wrong under the text field
instead of taking them to a separate page.

* HCI Guidline Three (URL):

* How you implemented it in your sketch:
